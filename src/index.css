/* @tailwind base; - Imports Tailwind's foundational styles */
/* This replaces browser default styles (like margins, fonts, colors) */
/* Provides consistent starting point across all browsers */
/* Think of it as "resetting" your webpage to a clean slate */
@tailwind base;

/* @tailwind components; - Imports pre-built component styles */
/* Provides reusable UI patterns like styled buttons, cards, forms */
/* Currently mostly empty but allows for custom component classes */
/* You can add your own components here later using @apply directive */
@tailwind components;

/* @tailwind utilities; - Imports thousands of utility classes */
/* These are the main Tailwind classes you'll use in your HTML */
/* Examples: text-blue-500, flex, p-4, hover:bg-red-200, etc. */
/* This is where the magic happens - replaces most custom CSS */
@tailwind utilities;

/* These 3 lines together give you the complete Tailwind CSS framework */
/* Order matters! Base → Components → Utilities (specificity increases) */
/* Now you can style with classes like: <div class="bg-blue-500 text-white p-4"> */
